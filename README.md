# Sentence-Extraction-using-Text-Rank-Algorithm

Information extraction is the process of extracting information from unstructured textual sources to enable finding entities as well as classifying and storing them in a database. Semantically enhanced information extraction (also known as semantic annotation) couples those entities with their semantic descriptions and connections from a knowledge graph. By adding metadata to the extracted concepts, this technology solves many challenges in enterprise content management and knowledge discovery.


Therefore, coming up with an automated way of extracting the information from textual data and presenting it in a structured manner will help us reap a lot of benefits and tremendously reduce the amount of time we have to spend time skimming through text documents. This is precisely what information extraction strives to achieve.
Using information extraction, we can retrieve pre-defined information such as the name of a person, location of an organization, or identify a relation between entities, and save this information in a structured format such as a database.
